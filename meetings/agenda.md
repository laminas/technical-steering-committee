## Items to Discuss
 
### Proposal to have a separate committee for marketing and outreach

In [the marketing-and-branding channel](https://laminas.slack.com/archives/C014W19NPV3), there have been discussions, recently, about how to help build awareness of the Laminas project, as well how we should approach marketing, branding, and outreach efforts. A proposal was put forward to have a committee separate to — yet which still overlaps and is answerable to — the TSC, which is directly responsible for these activities. This would allow those activities to happen in tandem to technical development of the project, while allowing those members of the TSC who aren't interested in these kinds of activities not to have to be involved with them.

### Proposal to hire a dedicated developer 

[Julian Somesan](https://github.com/arhimede) is proposing the below:

In the current open-source software ecosystem, the projects have became increasingly complex.
Becoming a contributor and maintainer for Laminas Project in particular is overly complicated, but willing developers are needed to push things forward.
There are months-old open issues and pull requests across their many repositories.
Apidemia, as official Laminas commercial vendor, proposes to hire [Alexis Karajos](https://github.com/alexmerlin) as a part-time employee (2-3 days per week) of Laminas Project.
In recent months, Alex Karajos, a valued and experienced employee of the Apidemia organization, has proven himself a capable contributor to several Laminas components.
Apidemia is willing to offer Alex's services for free, as an open source sponsorship.
Alex's purpose will be to manage open items and improve development flow across Laminas components.
