# Next Technical Steering Committee Meeting Agenda

- Date: 2022-02-07
- Time: 19:00 UTC

Please file pull requests to add, or discuss items to add, to the agenda.

## Items to Discuss

- Is “laminas-db” abandoned?
  - We have 15 opened pull request and 11 opened issues.
  - We have 3 non active mainteners on "laminas-db" project.
  - Last merge was 4 months ago.
  - Version 3 is not developed since 31 Dec 2019.
  - Unit tests have errors.
    Volunteer developers cannot complete the quest with CI on github and stop making contributions.
    For example, in laminas/laminas-db#232, the comment was changed, but the test failed!
    Give us local instrument for run tests (the best is Docker images on official repository).
  - Tests for Oracle are not support on CI.
