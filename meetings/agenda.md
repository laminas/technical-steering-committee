## Items to discuss

- New branch model on security-only repositories?

  As we are about to mark packages to receive security-only fixes, @boesing would like to discuss if we want to apply the new branch model (related to the new release-process) to those repositories aswell or if we exclude these?

- Vote on components to mark security only.

  Since we did not get 100% of the TSC to vote on the components to mark as security-only, we need to vote on them during the meeting. As a reminder, they are:

- @weierophinney proposes a by-law change to require only 2/3 of members vote for asynchronous votes. This ensures that if any member is unable to be present, we do not need to wait until the next TSC meeting to hold a vote.
