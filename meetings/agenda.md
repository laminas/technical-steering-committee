## Items to discuss

- Call for maintainers
  
  Lets talk about maintainers. 
  
  - Is there a list of current maintainers?
  - If not, how could we provide informations about our packages maintainers?
  
  Currently, the only way how a developer may become a maintainer of a package is, that he has to contribute and be visible for the TSC. But what, if a package cannot evolve that fast? What, if there are plenty of developers who might want to apply as a maintainer to help out but don't know how (due to lack of ideas for new features or lack of bugs - which should be good tho ;-))?
  
  We should probably consider an application of developers where they choose their favorite package. Probably like a job application (which is actually volunteering). Probably, developers want to apply to a package which is (currently) unmaintained.
  
  But first of all, we might need a list of packages which are maintained and which are not. Having that list be publicly available and visible (either on github and/or on the laminas website) will help all (especially the TSC) to see where maintainers are needed.
  
  Having that list will also help (current and potential new) maintainers to have visibility of their voluntary efforts. They could use it while applying on new jobs or whatsoever.
